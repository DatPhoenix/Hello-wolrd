# Hello-wolrd

Guden ladys and gentlelads. I am Josh aka DatPhoenix. 
I am a business administration student with his main branch being marketing and a passion fot Videogames. 
During the current Corona outrbreak i am trying to finally achieve something i always dreamed of as a kid: making my own game.

During this journey i try to learn as much about programming and web development as possible.
If everything goes well i might have found myself a fun, entertaining and fullfilling sidegig. 
If not i learned something valuable for my life that i can apply in both my private an professional life.
